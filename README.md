# guessing_game
My first CLI app made in Rust

You can install it if you want to, I don't want to, but you can.

## Installation Method

Clone the repo.

```{
git clone https://github.com/th0jensen/guessing_game.git && cd guessing_game
```

Install using cargo

```{
cargo install --path .
```
Don't have cargo yet? Skill issue.

```{
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```
Run the program and suffer:

```{
guessing_game
```
